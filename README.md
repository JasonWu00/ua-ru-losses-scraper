# ua-ru-losses-scraper
A little experiment to see if I can scrape the Oryx blog webpage for RU and UA vehicle losses.

The file placement is currently a bit of a mess. I will fix this into the future and shuffle files into an organized directory.

The important files are `losses_ru.csv` and `losses_ua.csv`, containing the main bulk of scraped data.
